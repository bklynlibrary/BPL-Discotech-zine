# How to use a DiscoTech in your library

Aside from being a fun event, a DiscoTech is a great, low-commitment way to find out what people in your community are interested in learning and teaching. Was a particular table extremely popular with a group your branch struggles to engage with, like older adults? Take the station lesson plan and work to expand it to a workshop, or a program. 

Do you have a community group that wants to, or already does hold workshops or clubs at your library around a specific technology topic, but perhaps they are not getting the attendance or diversity they would like? Invite them to a DiscoTech to reach a broader audience than they otherwise would. These events are great ways to share specific knowledge with people who otherwise might not seek it out.
