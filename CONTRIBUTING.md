# How to Contribute to the Zine
This is roughly listed in order of least commitment/work to most. All help is welcome!

- Set up a time to speak with Maya Wagoner about how you can get involved, or just to learn more: https://calendly.com/mayawagon 
- Do you know any good illustrators (or are you perhaps an illustrator)? Leave a comment with their name and portfolio/contact info on [the issue for finding illustrators for the zine](https://github.com/mayawagon/BPL-Discotech-zine/issues/5)
- Check out all the open [Issues](https://github.com/mayawagon/BPL-Discotech-zine/issues) to see what is still on the to-do list. You can leave a comment on any issue to ask a question, or if you feel comfortable, you can just get started working on it. Issues with the label "easy" might be good ones to start with. 
- Write a curriculum module for a DiscoTech station. Soon a form will be up to submit these, but for now, you can email them to mayawagon@gmail.com. 
- Write something else!
- Is there something that seems overlooked that you want to be part of the zine? Is there another problem? [Create a New Issue](https://github.com/mayawagon/BPL-Discotech-zine/issues/new)
